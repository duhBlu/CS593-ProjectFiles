Part 1: Basic Pathfinding (Page 1)

- You need to find a path through a maze from a given start state to a given goal state.
- The maze layout will be given to you in a simple text format, where '%' stands for walls, 'P' for the starting position, and '.' for the goal.
-  You need to select ONE from the following search algorithm Task choice 1 and the A* search algorithm in Task choice 2 for solving different mazes:
    - Task choice 1: Depth-first search or Breadth-first search.
    - Task choice 2: A* search.
- Run each of the above algorithms on the small maze, medium maze, big maze, and the open maze.
- For each problem instance and each search algorithm, report the following:
- The solution (Graphic Visualization) and its path cost.
    - Number of nodes expanded.
    - Maximum tree depth searched.
    - Maximum size of the fringe.

Part 2: Search with Multiple Goals (Page 1 & 2)

- You need to find the shortest path through a maze while hitting multiple goals.
- Revise your code from Part 1 to deal with this scenario.
- Run the two search algorithms from Part 1 on the tiny search, small search, and tricky search.
- For each search method and problem instance, report the solution cost and number of nodes expanded.
- Develop a strong heuristic to improve the chances of finding a solution in a timely manner.
- Discuss the chosen heuristic and provide an explanation for why it is admissible in the report.
