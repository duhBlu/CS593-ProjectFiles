    "- Goal Handling: In MazeMG, the goals are stored in a list and each goal is processed as it's found during the depth-first search (DFS). The algorithm continues even after a goal is found, until all goals have been found. In contrast, Maze only has one goal, so the DFS stops as soon as the goal is found.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Backtracking: In both classes, if a position doesn't lead to a goal, it's removed from the path (this is called backtracking) and added to the backtracked list. However, in MazeMG, a position is only backtracked if it's not a goal, whereas in Maze, a position is backtracked if it doesn't lead to the goal."
